# FA Simulator
This is a simple Finite Atutomata Simulator made in python using the PyGame Frame work.
A finite automaton (FA) is a simple idealized machine used to recognize patterns within input taken from some character set (or alphabet) C. The job of an FA is to accept or reject an input depending on whether the pattern defined by the FA occurs in the input.

This simulator helps to draw and test state machines (currently works on 2 inputs 'a' and 'b' only), Eliminating the need to draw on paper and manual testing.
